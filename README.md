# energy-trading

This study simulates the behaviour of individual Consumer and Prosumer participants in a blockchain-based energy trading market and the performance of the market as a whole.
The transaction logic is implemented as smart contracts in the Solidity language and deployed on the Remix IDE, a distributed application environment. Evaluate the efficiency of transactions by logging their execution and measuring gas costs. The following three types of trading algorithms were employed for matching and pricing between market participants and simulations were created. (1) The Gale-Shapley algorithm method, (2) Single-price auction method; and (3) Continuous trading method.
